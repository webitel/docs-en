ACR Scheme
==========

`ACR 
<https://github.com/webitel/acr>`_ (Advanced Call Routing) Scheme - route calls that match configured rules in JSON format. ACR Schemes are separated in two different route for different kinds of calls:

* **Default Route** handles calls originating from internal extensions 
* **Public Route** handles calls originating from the public phone network (`PSTN
  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_switched_telephone_network>`_).
